# CI/CD

### **Setup and Infrastructure**

- [ ]  Have you set up a dedicated Continuous Integration (CI) server/tool (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions)?
- [ ]  Do you have a separate environment for Continuous Deployment (CD) or Continuous Delivery?
- [ ]  Is your CI/CD infrastructure scalable to handle multiple builds and deployments simultaneously?
- [ ]  Have you ensured that CI/CD tools and environments are secured against unauthorized access?

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**

- [ ]  Do you have a CI pipeline that automatically triggers on code commits or pull/merge requests?
- [ ]  Is there a convention in place for commit messages to facilitate clear logs and changelogs?
- [ ]  Are build statuses (success/failure) communicated back to the development team in real-time?

### **Unit Testing in CI**

- [ ]  Does your CI pipeline include the automatic execution of unit tests?
- [ ]  Is there a mechanism to quickly identify and report which specific tests fail?
- [ ]  Does the CI pipeline halt or fail if any unit test fails, ensuring only quality code progresses?

### **Test Coverage Measurement**

- [ ]  Do you measure code coverage for your unit tests to ensure a significant portion of your codebase is tested?
- [ ]  Have you set a minimum code coverage percentage that must be met for the build to succeed?
- [ ]  Are reports on areas of the codebase lacking coverage made available to developers?

### **Static Code Analysis**

- [ ]  Have you integrated a static code analysis tool like SonarQube, ESLint, or others into your CI pipeline?
- [ ]  Does your CI pipeline fail if the code does not meet the defined quality or if there are critical issues flagged by the static code analysis?
- [ ]  Are developers given detailed feedback on what parts of their code violated the static analysis rules?

### **Dynamic Code Analysis**

- [ ]  Have you integrated a dynamic code analysis tool, such as HP Fortify or Veracode, to identify vulnerabilities at runtime?
- [ ]  Does your CI/CD pipeline ensure that flagged vulnerabilities are addressed before deploying to production?
- [ ]  Are there guidelines or training provided to developers to understand and rectify the vulnerabilities highlighted by dynamic analysis tools?

### **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)**

- [ ]  Do you have an automated deployment pipeline to push code changes to staging or production environments?
- [ ]  Are there rollback mechanisms in place in case a deployment introduces unforeseen issues?
- [ ]  Is there a monitoring solution in place post-deployment to keep an eye on application health and performance?

### **Integration with Other Tools**

- [ ]  Is your CI/CD pipeline integrated with your version control system (e.g., Git, Mercurial) for seamless operations?
- [ ]  Do you use containerization (like Docker) or orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) as part of your CD process?
- [ ]  Are deployment logs and details fed into a centralized logging or monitoring system for audit and analysis?

### **Feedback Loops and Notifications**

- [ ]  Are developers and relevant stakeholders notified of CI/CD successes and failures through channels like email, chat apps, or dashboards?
- [ ]  Is there a mechanism for developers to provide feedback on the CI/CD process and suggest improvements?
- [ ]  Are periodic reviews conducted to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the CI/CD pipelines?

### **Documentation and Training**

- [ ]  Have you documented the CI/CD processes, tools, and best practices for the benefit of current and new team members?
- [ ]  Do you provide training or workshops to keep the team updated on CI/CD best practices and tooling updates?
- [ ]  Are there resources available for developers to troubleshoot common CI/CD issues independently?
