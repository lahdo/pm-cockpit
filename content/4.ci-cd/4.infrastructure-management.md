# Infrastructure Management

### **Infrastructure Planning and Architecture**

- Have you conducted a thorough assessment of current and projected infrastructure needs based on business requirements?
- Is your infrastructure designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for growth and changes without major reworks?
- Have you considered both on-premises and cloud solutions, weighing the benefits and challenges of each?

### **Infrastructure Provisioning and Configuration**

- Do you use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools, such as Terraform or CloudFormation, to define and provision infrastructure resources?
- Are configurations standardized and stored in version control, allowing for auditability and reproducibility?
- Have you considered containerization (like Docker) or orchestration (like Kubernetes) for application deployment and scaling?

### **Infrastructure Monitoring and Logging**

- Do you have monitoring tools in place (like Nagios, Prometheus, or CloudWatch) to keep an eye on server health, resource utilization, and network performance?
- Are logs centralized using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog for easy analysis and alerting?
- Do you have alerts set up for critical events, ensuring rapid response to potential issues?

### **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

- Do you have a regular backup schedule for critical data, applications, and configurations?
- Are backups stored in multiple locations, including off-site or in a different region for redundancy?
- Have you documented and tested a disaster recovery plan to restore operations in case of significant infrastructure failures or data loss?

### **Security and Compliance**

- Are firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion prevention systems in place and appropriately configured?
- Do you conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and rectify potential security threats?
- If required by your industry, have you ensured compliance with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS?

### **Network Management**

- Is there a clear documentation of the network topology, detailing devices, connections, and IP addresses?
- Have you set up Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or dedicated lines for secure and reliable remote access?
- Do you employ network segmentation to isolate different parts of the infrastructure, reducing the potential impact of security breaches?

### **Capacity Planning and Performance Optimization**

- Do you review resource utilization trends to forecast infrastructure growth requirements?
- Are there procedures in place to optimize server performance, including load balancing and resource tuning?
- Do you review and optimize database performance, ensuring queries, storage, and backups are optimized?

### **Lifecycle Management**

- Do you have a policy for the lifecycle of servers, devices, and software, detailing procurement, maintenance, and retirement?
- Is there an established process for updating, patching, or replacing outdated software and hardware components?
- Are decommissioned devices securely wiped and disposed of, ensuring no sensitive data is leaked?

### **Vendor Management and Cost Control**

- Do you periodically review vendor contracts, ensuring you're getting value for money and that SLAs are being met?
- Have you set up tools or practices to monitor and control cloud infrastructure costs?
- Is there a process to evaluate and adopt new infrastructure technologies or services that might offer better performance or cost savings?

### **Documentation and Training**

- Is there a central repository or wiki detailing infrastructure setup, configurations, and best practices?
- Are team members trained on new infrastructure tools, practices, or policies as they're adopted?
- Do you have a clear line of communication for infrastructure-related updates, incidents, or changes?
