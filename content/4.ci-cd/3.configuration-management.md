# Configuration Management

### **Configuration Standardization and Automation**

- [ ]  Have you identified all configurable elements in your system (software, hardware, documentation, etc.)?
- [ ]  Are configurations done automatically based on the target environment (e.g., dev, staging, production) using tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, or SaltStack?
- [ ]  Is the infrastructure defined as code using platforms like Terraform, ensuring that the environment setup is reproducible and versioned?

### **Versioning and Repository Management**

- [ ]  Is all configuration data version-controlled using tools like Git, ensuring a history of changes and facilitating rollbacks if necessary?
- [ ]  Are there dedicated branches or tags in the version control system to represent different environments or significant configurations?
- [ ]  Do you utilize repository hosting solutions like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, which provide additional features for collaboration, pull requests, and reviews?

### **Change Control and Auditing**

- [ ]  Is there a formal process for requesting, reviewing, approving, and implementing configuration changes?
- [ ]  Do you maintain an audit trail for all configuration changes, including who made the change, when, and why?
- [ ]  Are there automated checks in place to verify and validate configuration changes before they are applied to the target environment?

### **Security and Access Control**

- [ ]  Are sensitive configurations (like API keys, credentials, etc.) encrypted and securely managed using tools like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager?
- [ ]  Do you have role-based access controls (RBAC) in place to ensure that only authorized personnel can make configuration changes?
- [ ]  Are there measures in place to detect and alert unauthorized or suspicious configuration changes?

### **Environment Consistency and Drift Management**

- [ ]  Do you periodically verify that the actual system configuration matches the defined and expected configuration?
- [ ]  Have you implemented tools or processes to detect configuration drift and either alert or automatically rectify them?
- [ ]  Is there a process to synchronize configurations across similar environments, ensuring consistency?

### **Backup and Recovery**

- [ ]  Do you regularly back up configuration data, ensuring that you can restore configurations if needed?
- [ ]  Are configuration backups stored securely, with restricted access and, if necessary, encryption?
- [ ]  Have you tested the recovery process of configurations from backups to ensure they are accurate and complete?

### **Documentation and Communication**

- [ ]  Is there a central repository or documentation that describes the purpose, structure, and guidelines for each configuration element?
- [ ]  Are stakeholders notified of significant configuration changes, especially ones that might affect system behavior or integrations?
- [ ]  Do team members have access to training or resources on configuration management tools, practices, and policies?

### **Continuous Integration and Deployment**

- [ ]  Is configuration management integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring configurations are applied during build and deployment processes?
- [ ]  Do you have automated tests to verify that configurations are correctly applied and functional in the target environment?
- [ ]  Are there measures in place to roll back configurations in case of deployment failures or detected issues?

### **Feedback and Improvement**

- [ ]  Is there a feedback loop in place for developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders to report and address configuration-related issues or improvements?
- [ ]  Do you periodically review and refine configuration management practices based on lessons learned, new technologies, or evolving business requirements?
- [ ]  Are post-incident reviews conducted when configuration errors lead to system failures or downtimes to prevent recurrence?
