# Code Reviews

### **Code Review Process**

- [ ]  Do you mandate code reviews for all pull/merge requests, regardless of the size or developer's seniority?
- [ ]  Are emergency or "hotfix" changes subject to a different review process or the same?
- [ ]  Have you documented the entire code review process, ensuring clarity and understanding among the team?

### Reviewer Selection

- [ ]  Do you have a strategy or criteria to select code reviewers, ensuring that the most appropriate developer reviews the code?
- [ ]  Is there a rotation system in place to ensure all team members participate in the review process, ensuring shared knowledge?
- [ ]  Do you ensure that both junior and senior developers get to review code, promoting a culture of collective learning?

### **Code Review Checklist**

- [ ]  Have you standardized a code review checklist, which guides developers on what to look out for during reviews?
- [ ]  Does the checklist emphasize not only code correctness but also readability, maintainability, and potential performance issues?
- [ ]  Do you periodically update the checklist based on new learnings, feedback, or changes in coding standards?

### **Review Tools**

- [ ]  Do you utilize a dedicated tool or platform for code reviews, such as Gerrit, GitHub, or GitLab?
- [ ]  Are developers trained on how to effectively use these tools, maximizing their features for a smoother review process?
- [ ]  Is there a mechanism to integrate these tools with other platforms, like CI/CD pipelines, to ensure code quality even before review?

### **Approval System**

- [ ]  Have you set a defined number of approvals needed before code is merged? (e.g., 2 reviewers)
- [ ]  Do you have a system to escalate or address situations where there's a disagreement between reviewers?
- [ ]  Are there guidelines on how soon a review should be conducted after a request is made, ensuring timely feedback?

### Feedback Culture

- [ ]  Do you encourage constructive feedback, emphasizing the difference between critiquing the code and critiquing the coder?
- [ ]  Do you periodically gather feedback on the review process itself, making improvements based on the team's experiences?

### **Review Depth**

- [ ]  Does your team differentiate between different depths or types of reviews (e.g., superficial vs. deep dive reviews) based on the nature of the changes?
- [ ]  Are there guidelines on which sections of the code require more rigorous scrutiny, such as security-critical sections?
- [ ]  How does the code review process align with sprint or project timelines, ensuring that reviews don't become a bottleneck?
