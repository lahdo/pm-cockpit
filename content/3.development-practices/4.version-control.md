# Version Control

### **Commit Discipline**

- [ ]  Do developers make atomic commits, ensuring each commit addresses only one logical change?
- [ ]  Are commit messages clear, concise, and formatted with a short summary followed by a detailed explanation if necessary?
- [ ]  Are developers encouraged to ensure that code changes within a commit directly relate to the commit message?
- [ ]  Do developers commit changes frequently to keep the commit size manageable and to avoid bundling unrelated changes?

### **Repository Management**

- [ ]  Are files that can be derived from other files in the repository (like build outputs) excluded from version control?
- [ ]  Is there a strict policy in place that prevents direct commits or pushes to critical branches like **`master`** or **`main`**?
- [ ]  Have you set up a clear **`.gitconfig`** template with essential configurations for developers to follow, ensuring consistency in commit metadata?
- [ ]  Is there a well-maintained **`.gitignore`** file that excludes unnecessary files (like local configurations, temporary files, and IDE-specific files) from the repository?
- [ ]  Do you periodically review and prune stale branches from the repository to maintain clarity and order?

### **Branching and Merging Strategy**

- [ ]  Have you established a branching strategy (like Git Flow or Trunk Based Development) and provided guidelines and training to developers on it?
- [ ]  Is there a naming convention for branches? For example, do feature branches start with the ticket or issue number for easy traceability?
- [ ]  Is there a pull request (or merge request) template in place to ensure all necessary details are provided during code merges?
- [ ]  Do you ensure that all pull requests have a designated reviewer, and are they reviewed and tested before merging?
- [ ]  Are hotfixes or critical patches treated with a separate branching strategy or flow to ensure rapid deployment without compromising stability?

### **Tooling and Automation**

- [ ]  Have you set up pre-commit hooks to perform tasks like linting, format checking, or even running unit tests before allowing commits?
- [ ]  Do you use other Git hooks, like pre-push, to ensure code quality and adherence to standards?
- [ ]  Are there automated checks on pull requests, such as Continuous Integration builds, to validate changes before they are merged?
- [ ]  Do you utilize any tools for visualizing branch history, conflicts, and merges for better understanding and management?

### **Collaboration and Workflow**

- [ ]  Do you encourage developers to rebase their branches frequently to incorporate the latest changes from the main branch and ensure a linear history?
- [ ]  Is there a clear guideline on how to handle merge conflicts, ensuring developers address them correctly without inadvertently overwriting valuable changes?
- [ ]  Are there regular sync-up meetings or sessions to discuss version control challenges, best practices, or updates?

### **Documentation and Training**

- [ ]  Is there a dedicated documentation or wiki page outlining the version control practices, branching strategies, and tool usage for the team?
- [ ]  Do you conduct regular training or workshops to address common version control challenges or introduce newer best practices?
- [ ]  Are developers provided with resources, cheat sheets, or tools to help them navigate complex version control scenarios?
