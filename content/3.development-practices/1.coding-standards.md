# Coding Standards

### **Definition and Clarity**

- [ ]  Have you established a clear and comprehensive set of coding standards for the languages and technologies used in your project?
- [ ]  Are the standards based on recognized best practices from the broader developer community or are they custom to fit the unique requirements of your project?
- [ ]  Do you provide explanations or rationales behind each standard to help developers understand their importance and context?

### **Documentation and Accessibility**

- [ ]  Are the coding standards documented in an accessible format, like a wiki or dedicated website, for easy reference?
- [ ]  Have you provided examples in the documentation to illustrate correct and incorrect usage for clarity?
- [ ]  Is the documentation versioned, and are there archives of previous versions in case of reference needs or audits?

### **Tools and Automation**

- [ ]  Do you use linting tools (like ESLint, TSLint, or Pylint) to automatically enforce coding standards during development?
- [ ]  Are there pre-commit or pre-push hooks set up to ensure code adheres to standards before being submitted to the version control system?
- [ ]  Do you use automated code formatting tools (like Prettier or Black) to ensure consistent code styling across the codebase?

### **Training and Onboarding**

- [ ]  Is there a training session or workshop for new team members to familiarize them with the coding standards?
- [ ]  Do you provide refresher sessions or updates whenever there are significant changes to the standards?
- [ ]  Are there mentors or leads designated to guide developers, especially juniors, on understanding and adhering to the coding standards?

### **Feedback and Iteration**

- [ ]  Is there a feedback mechanism where developers can suggest changes or improvements to the coding standards?
- [ ]  Do you conduct periodic reviews of the coding standards to ensure they are still relevant, effective, and not overly restrictive?
- [ ]  Are there retrospective discussions when significant coding standard violations occur, to understand root causes and prevent future occurrences?

### **Integration with Other Processes**

- [ ]  Is adherence to coding standards a part of the code review checklist?
- [ ]  Do you integrate coding standards checks into your CI/CD pipeline to catch violations early and automatically?
- [ ]  How do you handle dependencies or third-party code? Is there a separate standard or exclusion for them?

### **Culture and Mindset**

- [ ]  Do you promote a culture where adhering to coding standards is seen as a shared responsibility and not just a formality?
- [ ]  Are there mechanisms to recognize and appreciate developers who consistently write well-structured and standard-compliant code?
- [ ]  Do you emphasize the value of coding standards in terms of code maintainability, readability, and overall software quality?

### **Periodic Review and Updates**

- [ ]  Is there a scheduled review of coding standards to adapt to newer practices, technologies, or project requirements?
- [ ]  Are changes to coding standards communicated promptly and effectively to the entire development team?
- [ ]  When there are updates, is there a plan or strategy to refactor or update existing code to the latest standards, if needed?
