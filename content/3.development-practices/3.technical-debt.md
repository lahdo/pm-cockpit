# Technical Debt

### Understanding Technical Debt

- [ ]  Do you have a clear definition of what constitutes technical debt within your organization or project?
- [ ]  Are team members trained to identify and differentiate between intentional technical debt (taken for a strategic reason) and unintentional technical debt (resulting from oversight or lack of knowledge)?
- [ ]  Do you periodically hold discussions or workshops to clarify the implications of technical debt on the project's health and longevity?

### Tracking and Documentation

- [ ]  Do you utilize specific tools or sections within tools (like JIRA) dedicated to tracking technical debt items?
- [ ]  When technical debt is introduced intentionally, is it documented along with the reason for its introduction and a plan for its future resolution?
- [ ]  Do you categorize technical debt based on severity, impact, and ease of resolution to prioritize which debts to tackle first?

### Metrics and Analysis

- [ ]  Are there metrics in place to gauge the amount and impact of technical debt, such as code churn, increased bug rate, or longer feature development times?
- [ ]  Do you review these metrics periodically to assess the growing or reducing trend of technical debt?
- [ ]  Is there a process to correlate specific technical debt items with their impact on the project, like certain debt leading to a spike in defects?

### Resolution Strategies

- [ ]  Is there a dedicated time, like "tech-debt days" or a certain percentage of each sprint, allocated to address and reduce technical debt?
- [ ]  Do you employ techniques like code refactoring, redesign, or even rewriting as strategies to resolve technical debt?
- [ ]  Do you have a roadmap for addressing high-priority or high-impact technical debt items?

### Communication and Visibility

- [ ]  Is technical debt made visible to all stakeholders, including non-technical ones, to ensure collective understanding of its implications?
- [ ]  Are there regular updates or discussions on the current state of technical debt during team meetings or retrospectives?
- [ ]  Is there a feedback loop to ensure that the reasons for accruing technical debt are addressed, preventing the same patterns from recurring?

### Tooling and Automation

- [ ]  Do you leverage static code analysis tools, which can automatically identify potential technical debt or code smells?
- [ ]  Are there automated tests in place which can be run before and after addressing technical debt to ensure no functionality is broken?
- [ ]  Do you use tools to visualize technical debt, like dependency graphs or architectural diagrams, to understand its spread and interconnectedness?

### Continuous Learning and Improvement

- [ ]  When technical debt leads to significant issues or slowdowns, do you conduct a root cause analysis to learn and adapt from the situation?
- [ ]  Are there resources or training available for the team to learn about best practices, reducing the unintentional introduction of technical debt?
- [ ]  Is there a mechanism to celebrate or acknowledge when significant technical debt is addressed, reinforcing its importance?
