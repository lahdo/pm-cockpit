# Test Case management

### **Test Case Creation and Repository**

- [ ]  **Centralized Repository:** Do you store all test cases in a single, centralized system for easy access and management?
- [ ]  **Standardized Templates:** Do you use standardized templates for creating test cases to ensure all necessary details are captured?
- [ ]  **Version Control:** Are test cases versioned, ensuring changes over time can be tracked and old versions can be retrieved if needed?
- [ ]  **Parameterization:** Do you support parameterized testing, allowing the reuse of test cases with different input values?

### **Test Case Classification and Organization**

- [ ]  **Categorization:** Are test cases categorized based on module, feature, or user story they relate to?
- [ ]  **Types of Testing:** Do test cases specify the type of testing they pertain to (e.g., functional, integration, performance, usability)?
- [ ]  **Priority Setting:** Are test cases prioritized, indicating which ones are critical and should be executed first?

### **Test Case Execution and Management**

- [ ]  **Execution Plans:** Do you create test execution plans detailing which test cases to run, in which environment, and in what order?
- [ ]  **Test Environments:** Are test cases associated with specific test environments or configurations?
- [ ]  **Automated vs Manual:** Are test cases clearly labeled as automated, manual, or automatable for future reference?

### **Test Case Reviews and Maintenance**

- [ ]  **Review Cycle:** Are test cases peer-reviewed to ensure accuracy and completeness?
- [ ]  **Maintenance Cycle:** Is there a process to periodically review and update test cases to ensure they remain relevant and effective?
- [ ]  **Obsolete Tests:** Do you have a process to identify and archive or delete obsolete test cases?

### **Results and Defect Linking**

- [ ]  **Results Logging:** Are results for each test case execution logged and stored in the repository?
- [ ]  **Defect Linking:** Can failed test cases be directly linked to defects, ensuring traceability and facilitating debugging?

### **Coverage and Metrics**

- [ ]  **Coverage Analysis:** Do you analyze how much of your application's functionality is covered by your test cases?
- [ ]  **Metrics and Reports:** Do you generate metrics like pass rate, test effectiveness, and defect density to measure the quality of testing and the product?

### **Collaboration and Feedback Loop**

- [ ]  **Collaborative Tools:** Does your test case management system support collaboration, like comments, attachments, and shared views?
- [ ]  **Feedback Channels:** Do you have channels for testers to provide feedback on test cases, improving them over time?

### **Integration and Tool Compatibility**

- [ ]  **Tool Integration:** Is your test case management system integrated with other tools like defect trackers, CI/CD pipelines, and version control systems?
- [ ]  **Import/Export Capabilities:** Can test cases be easily imported/exported for sharing, backup, or migration purposes?

### **Documentation and Training**

- [ ]  **Best Practices:** Are best practices for creating effective test cases documented and shared with the testing team?
- [ ]  **Training:** Are new testers trained on how to use the test case management system effectively?
