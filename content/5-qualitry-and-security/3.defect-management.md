# Defect management

### **Defect Tracking and Repository**

- **Single Source:** Do you track all bugs in a single, centralized system to maintain a single source of truth?
- **Specialized Tool:** Do you use a specialized defect tracking system or tool, like JIRA, Bugzilla, or MantisBT?
- **Linking Issues:** Can defects be linked to related items, such as requirements, user stories, or code commits?
- **Historical Data:** Does your system retain the history of each defect, capturing every change, comment, and status update?

### **Defect Classification**

- **Severity Levels:** Are defects classified by their severity, indicating the impact on the system (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial)?
- **Priority Levels:** Does every defect have a defined priority, indicating the order in which it should be addressed (e.g., High, Medium, Low)?
- **Type:** Are defects categorized by type, such as functional, performance, security, or UI/UX bugs?

### **Defect Workflow and Lifecycle**

- **Statuses:** Does your defect lifecycle define clear statuses, such as New, In Progress, Resolved, Verified, and Closed?
- **Triage Process:** Do you have a defect triage process where new defects are reviewed, assessed, and assigned?
- **Resolution:** Are resolved defects verified by quality assurance or the original reporter before being closed?

### **Change Management**

- **Differentiation:** Do you clearly differentiate between bugs (unintended system behaviors) and change requests (new features or improvements)?
- **Linking:** Can change requests be linked to associated bugs, highlighting dependencies or relationships?

### **Defect Reporting and Analysis**

- **Templates:** Do you use standardized templates or forms for defect reporting to ensure all necessary information is captured?
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Is there a process to perform root cause analysis on critical or recurring defects to prevent future occurrences?
- **Metrics:** Do you regularly analyze defect metrics, such as defect density, open-to-close ratios, or time-to-resolution, to gauge product quality and process efficiency?

### **Defect Collaboration and Communication**

- **Notification:** Does your defect management tool notify relevant stakeholders (like developers, testers, and managers) about new defects, status changes, or comments?
- **Collaboration Tools:** Are there integrated collaboration tools (e.g., chat, screen sharing) to facilitate communication about defects?

### **Feedback Loop**

- **Feedback Mechanism:** Do you have a mechanism for end-users or customers to report defects or issues they encounter?
- **Acknowledgment:** Are reporters of defects acknowledged and kept informed about the progress and resolution of their reported issues?

### **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**

- **Documentation:** Are solutions or workarounds for common or critical defects documented and shared with relevant teams or stakeholders?
- **Learning and Training:** Are lessons learned from critical defects incorporated into training material or knowledge-sharing sessions?
