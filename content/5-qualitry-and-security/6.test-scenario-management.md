# Test Scenario management

### **Test Scenario Creation and Identification**

- **User Stories and Requirements:** Are test scenarios derived directly from user stories, requirements, or features to ensure coverage?
- **Diverse Perspectives:** Do you involve different roles (e.g., QA, Business Analysts, End-Users) in creating or reviewing scenarios to capture varied perspectives?
- **Descriptive Names:** Do the scenarios have descriptive titles that give a clear idea of the functionality or journey being tested?

### **Organization and Prioritization**

- **Grouping:** Are test scenarios grouped or categorized by modules, features, or user roles?
- **Priority Setting:** Have test scenarios been prioritized based on their importance, frequency of use, or risk?

### **Traceability and Coverage**

- **Traceability Matrix:** Do you maintain a traceability matrix to map test scenarios to requirements or user stories, ensuring complete coverage?
- **Gap Analysis:** Is there a periodic review to identify any gaps in scenarios, based on new features or changes in the software?

### **Documentation and Details**

- **Preconditions:** Are the initial conditions or setups required for each scenario clearly mentioned?
- **Postconditions:** Do you specify the expected state of the system after the scenario has been executed?
- **Assumptions:** Are any assumptions made while defining the scenario clearly documented?

### **Reusability and Parameterization**

- **Modularity:** Are common steps or sequences modularized for reuse across multiple test scenarios?
- **Parameterization:** Do you design scenarios in a way that they can be executed with multiple sets of data?

### **Review and Maintenance**

- **Review Process:** Are test scenarios periodically reviewed by peers or stakeholders to ensure their relevancy and accuracy?
- **Change Management:** Is there a process in place to update test scenarios based on feedback from execution, changes in the system, or evolving user behavior?

### **Execution Strategy**

- **Automation Feasibility:** Do you assess which test scenarios are good candidates for automation vs. those that should remain manual?
- **Environment Specification:** Do you specify which environment configurations (e.g., browsers, OS, devices) each scenario should be tested on?

### **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**

- **Feedback Loop:** Is there a mechanism for testers to provide feedback on test scenarios after execution?
- **Historical Analysis:** Do you analyze past defects to see if there's a need for new test scenarios or modifications to existing ones?

### **Collaboration and Sharing**

- **Collaborative Platform:** Do you use a platform that allows for easy collaboration, commenting, and sharing of test scenarios?
- **Stakeholder Visibility:** Are stakeholders (like product managers, developers, or even clients) given visibility into key test scenarios to align understanding and expectations?

### **Training and Best Practices**

- **Best Practices Document:** Do you maintain a document or guideline on best practices for creating effective test scenarios?
- **Training:** Are team members trained periodically on these best practices and the importance of test scenarios in the QA process?
