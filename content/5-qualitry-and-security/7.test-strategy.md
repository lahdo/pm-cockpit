# Test Scenario management

### **Scope and Objective**

- [ ]  **Clear Objectives:** Have you defined the primary goals and objectives of the testing effort?
- [ ]  **Project Overview:** Does the strategy provide a brief overview of the software/product being tested?
- [ ]  **Feature Prioritization:** Have features/modules been prioritized based on their importance, complexity, and risk?

### **Test Levels and Types**

- [ ]  **Defined Levels:** Have you outlined which test levels (unit, integration, system, etc.) will be conducted?
- [ ]  **Test Types:** Have you specified the types of testing to be performed (e.g., functional, performance, security, usability)?

### **Resource Allocation**

- [ ]  **Roles & Responsibilities:** Have roles and responsibilities for all team members been clearly defined?
- [ ]  **Team Structure:** Is there a clear team structure, including leads, senior testers, junior testers, and any specialized roles?
- [ ]  **Training:** Are there plans for any required training or skill development for the team?

### **Environment and Tools**

- [ ]  **Test Environments:** Have you specified the test environments, including hardware, software, and network configurations?
- [ ]  **Tools Selection:** Have you listed and justified the tools to be used for test management, defect tracking, automation, and any other specific needs?
- [ ]  **Tool Integration:** Is there a plan for how various tools will integrate with each other and the broader CI/CD pipeline?

### **Risk Management**

- [ ]  **Risk Identification:** Have potential risks to the testing process been identified?
- [ ]  **Risk Assessment:** Are the identified risks ranked based on likelihood and impact?
- [ ]  **Mitigation Plans:** Have mitigation strategies and contingency plans been laid out for each identified risk?

### **Deliverables**

- [ ]  **List of Deliverables:** Have you specified all deliverables, including test plans, test cases, defect reports, and status reports?
- [ ]  **Documentation Standards:** Are there defined standards and templates for all testing-related documentation?

### **Test Metrics and Measurement**

- [ ]  **Metrics Selection:** Have you defined which metrics will be used to measure and report the testing effort's progress and quality?
- [ ]  **Metrics Goals:** Are there established target values or ranges for each metric?

### **Stakeholder Communication**

- [ ]  **Communication Plan:** Is there a plan outlining how and when stakeholders will be informed about testing progress, risks, and results?
- [ ]  **Feedback Channels:** Are channels established for stakeholders to provide feedback on the testing process?

### **Entry and Exit Criteria**

- [ ]  **Defined Criteria:** Have you clearly outlined the entry criteria (when to start testing) and the exit criteria (when to stop testing)?

### **Review and Update Cycle**

- [ ]  **Periodic Reviews:** Is there a plan for periodic strategy reviews to ensure its ongoing relevancy?
- [ ]  **Change Management:** How will changes to the test strategy be proposed, evaluated, and implemented?

### **Archiving and Lessons Learned**

- [ ]  **Archiving Process:** Is there a process to archive all relevant documentation and test artifacts once testing is complete?
- [ ]  **Retrospectives:** Is there a mechanism to conduct retrospectives post-release to glean lessons learned and refine the test strategy for future projects?
