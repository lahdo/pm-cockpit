### **Feedback and Review**

- [ ]  Are any impediments or blockers raised by the team addressed in a timely manner to ensure sprint goals can be achieved?

### **Metrics and Continuous Improvement**

- [ ]  Do you track key Agile metrics, such as velocity, sprint burndown, and cumulative flow?
- [ ]  Are these metrics reviewed regularly to identify trends, issues, or areas for improvement?
- [ ]  Is there a commitment to continuous improvement, with changes implemented based on feedback, retrospectives, and metrics?

### **Training and Resources**
